# AdventOfCode
My own implemented solutions using Pharo Smalltalk for Advent of Code coding challenge [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

## How to execute
Just simply execute (inspect/print it) in Pharo Playground e.g.: `AoC2019 day: 1 part: 1` and you get result.
Not yet implemented solutions will throw error, e.g.: `"AoC 2019 - solution not found for day: 20 ' part: 2."`

## Completed Exercises
Just look at class determining given year, complete solutions can be found by evaluating e.g.: `AoC2019 aocSolutionClasses`
