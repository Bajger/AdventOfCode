# AdventOfCode
My own implemented solutions using [Pharo](https://pharo.org) Smalltalk for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) coding challenge.

## How to execute
Each year is represented by `AoC<year nr.>` class, like this: `AoC2019`.  
To get result for given day and part of Advent of Code, just simply execute (inspect/print it) in Pharo Playground e.g.:  
`AoC2019 day: 1 part: 1` and you get result.  
Not yet implemented solutions will throw error, e.g.: "AoC 2019 - solution not found for day: 20 part: 2."  

## Completed Exercises
Just look at class determining given year, complete solutions can be found by evaluating e.g.: `AoC2019 aocSolutionClasses`  
Each class represents one concrete solution for given day and part.
